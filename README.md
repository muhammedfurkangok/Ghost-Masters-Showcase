# Ghost Masters  

**Ghost Masters** is an **arcade idle game** I developed during my internship at **Furtle Game Company**.  
In this project, I was responsible for implementing most of the game systems shown in the video.  

> 📌 Due to project constraints, I have only shared the script files, as some assets are not my own.
